                        <p class=text-justify>I am a father and husband living in Bognor Regis which is located on the south coast of England.</p>
                        <p class=text-justify>I work for British Telecom as a product specialist for SIP-based trader voice solutions and I am interested in a wide range of topics relating to IT in general. I started out as an apprentice working in a general admin job at BT and once I completed my apprenticeship I felt like I needed to do more. On the recommendation of a family member who had recently retired from GCHQ I began studying for my CCNA. After about of year of study (I had never done anything involving data networks before) and two failed attempts, I finally passed my CCNA. I immediately started applying for jobs with my new CCNA only to have the same issue that many people have, I didn't have the experience required to get a job that actually used my qualification. After a year of applying for jobs inside BT (I know, I should have looked elsewhere too) I finally got an interview and a job with BT Trading Systems from a fantastic manager who was willing to take a chance on someone who was willing to learn. Working at BT Trading systems completely opened the door to a side of the IT industry that I never even considered had existed.</p>
                        <p class=text-justify>Since then I have become far more interested in all aspects of computing. I started out with just networking but quickly got into virtualisation (initially with VMware) and Linux systems as we were using them at work. and from there I became intrigued by web design, development and hosting. From that I got into programming and created an online schedule for my team at work, this was written in PHP with a MySQL backend, a few bits of Javascript/jQuery and Bootstrap on the front. In all honesty I had looked into learning Python before this but I didn't get too far with it. It is now the Python renaissance as it were and I am trying to learn as much as I can about it at the moment.</p>
