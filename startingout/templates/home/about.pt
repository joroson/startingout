                            This website is constantly evolving/changing. It started out as a WordPress site, I then decided to redo
                            it as a static HTML site and now it is running on Python/Pyramid/uWSGI and served out via an NGINX Proxy
                            Manager docker container.
                        </p>

                            Why did I move from hither to thither? I do feel like Python is the programming language for the people. It
                            is all well and good doing things with WordPress/PHP but if you can write a program and turn it into a "web
                            application" with Python you have many more options available to you and there are many things that can be
                            done. It was with that in mind that I set out to turn one of the functions that I had written, a simple
                            <a href="/mini-scripts/weight-conversion">weight converter</a> into something that I could use online
                            instead of in a Jupyter notebook or REPL. That is/was my first <a href="/mini-scripts">Mini-script</a> and
                            the reason that this site now exists as it does. Whilst I certainly could have done this quite simply with
                            Javascript and had a weight converter that did everything in the browser; it wouldn't have been as much fun
                            as doing everything server-side on a ridiculously powerful VPS.
                        </p>

                            From here the plan is to re-work the backend. The implementation as it is now is not as tidy as it should
                            be and I will remove those issues before progressing to something with more features. Unless, of course,
                            I think of another Mini-Script that would be useful to have and simple to code.

                            I am a father and husband living in Bognor Regis which is located on the south coast of England.

                            I work for British Telecom as a product specialist for SIP-based trader voice solutions and I am interested
                            in a wide range of topics relating to IT in general. I started out as an apprentice working in a general
                            admin job at BT and once I completed my apprenticeship I felt like I needed to do more. On the recommendation
                            of a family member who had recently retired from GCHQ I began studying for my CCNA. After about of year of
                            study (I had never done anything involving data networks before) and two failed attempts, I finally passed
                            my CCNA. I immediately started applying for jobs with my new CCNA only to have the same issue that many
                            people have, I didn't have the experience required to get a job that actually used my qualification. After
                            a year of applying for jobs inside BT (I know, I should have looked elsewhere too) I finally got an
                            interview and a job with BT Trading Systems from a fantastic manager who was willing to take a chance on
                            someone who was willing to learn. Working at BT Trading systems completely opened the door to a side of the
                            IT industry that I never even considered had existed.

                        <p class=text-justify>
                            Since then I have become far more interested in all aspects of computing. I started out  with just networking
                            but quickly got into virtualisation (initially with VMware) and Linux systems as we were using them at work.
                            From there I became intrigued by web design, development and hosting. From that I got into programming and
                            created an online schedule for my team at work, this was written in PHP with a MySQL backend, a few bits of
                            Javascript/jQuery and Bootstrap on the front. In all honesty I had looked into learning Python before this
                            but I didn't get too far with it. For the past while I have been focusing more on Python, in fact, this website
                            is "written in" Python and uses the Pyramid framework.</p>
